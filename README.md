This is a fully functional weather application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to search for any city and view real-time weather information including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions. It fetches live data from a weather API and updates the interface dynamically without reloading the page. The application has a clean and responsive design, making it suitable for both desktop and mobile devices. It does not require any backend, as all data handling is done on the client side. The project is deployed using GitHub Pages and can be accessed live at https://kattacharan23.github.io/Weather-Report/
